                Before taking up the TDC programme my mental health was the
                lowest it’s been in terms of being so unhappy with the way I
                looked and I was battling body dysmorphia along with being so
                depressed with how unfit I was. As a young person, mental
                health, physical health and the way you look is scrutinised, all
                due to how much of an impact social media has on all of us. This
                was then affected even more during the lockdown and the
                Coronavirus. The lockdown was a breaking point for me, and I
                understood that if I didn't make a change, my life would only
                collapse and decline even more. Following Coach Thom on
                Instagram, I was inspired by how he stayed fit during a lockdown
                with homework outs and outdoor runs. That's when I decided to
                speak to him about my situation and solve my ongoing issues for
                years.

                I listened to his advice and day by day I started to do
                something productive that would benefit my health; this then had
                a domino effect on my mental health, allowing me to progress and
                become more happy by staying consistent. When the gyms re-opened
                I signed up to TDC Coaching and this is when my life changed. As
                someone who has been trying to get fit for a long time. I always
                lacked consistency with my diet, fitness routine, and most
                specifically, nutrition. Coach Thom helped me by taking his time
                and listening to my goals that I wanted to achieve. He then put
                together a plan which allowed me to stay consistent with my
                workouts and my diet, introducing me to tracking macros.

                Since then, honestly, my progress has not stopped and I am
                loving every day of my life right now. I am truly thankful for
                everything Thom has done for me and my mental health

                I’ve been training for a few years now but only started to train
                with Thom for the last 6-8 months. One thing I’ve always
                struggled with is my diet and tracking food; this has all
                changed since training with Thom. I’ve been focused on my diet
                more than ever; the balance is great as I can still eat foods I
                enjoy the most. Thom is always accessible, and if I have any
                queries about my training or my diet, he’s always there to
                answer with knowledgeable answers, not just what you want to
                hear.

                The best thing about training with Thom is the app that he has.
                This has made training so much easier as all I have to do is get
                to the gym and not worry about what I’m training or what my next
                exercise is as it’s already written out for me. Another great
                thing about Thom’s app is the result tracking, this for me is
                one of the main factors as I’m making sure I’m progressively
                overloading each week. If anyone is looking for a PT or even
                just a coach like he is for me, then I cannot recommend him
                enough. I’m more motivated than ever and we’re both excited
                about the goals we’re going to achieve.

                Hi guys, it’s Clarence here. Everyone who knows me knows that
                Thom plays a huge part in my fitness journey and he’s taught me
                a lot. I think the most important thing he’s taught me is
                consistency and balance. He has tailored the workouts to fit my
                lifestyle, my job and what I do day to day. Initially we had six
                sessions together, once a week. At the end of those six weeks I
                felt mentally better, I felt good, I never walked out of a
                session not feeling better than I did before doing them. That
                really did it for me and at the end of the 6 weeks, I looked in
                the mirror and I noticed changes. That really boosted my
                confidence and it made me feel like “yes I can be a better
                version of me” because I always thought “they can but I can’t”.
                I feel like a lot of people feel that way.

                Whether it’s metabolism, work or just comparing yourself to
                other people in day to day life and on social media, you know it
                happens. I never thought I could do it and Thom really built my
                confidence and he’s really pushing me to be the best that I can
                be without any dieting or anything crazy. In fact, he encourages
                me to eat more so it really works for me. If you’re a lazy
                person (like me), and you want to work out and want to make a
                lifestyle change, you really can. I think having the sessions
                with Thom keeps me on track. Despite being a bit more confident
                with using the gym and doing my own thing, I still do the PT
                sessions and it’s been years. It really keeps me on track, it
                keeps me focused and I’m really grateful for them. So, thank you
                Thom.

                lockdown arrived, I had lost all motivation and my food choices
                had taken a turn for the worse. Having known Thom for a while
                from a pervious gym we got to chatting on Instagram and Thom
                managed to re-motivate me before the gyms re-opened. Having
                acknowledged that I had gained some weight over the lock down
                period I decide to begin training with Thom. Thom is a very
                considerate coach and he really thinks about his clients and
                wants them to be the best they can be, whilst acknowledging
                their lifestyle and time limitations.Thom took time to
                understand what I wanted to achieve and tailored a plan that
                would work for me. Although I had been training for a few years
                already it never felt that structured.

                Thom’s training programme has given me a new routine and
                structure. It has also taught me the importance of food and
                getting the right balance of macros. When I first looked at the
                plan and how much Thom was asking me to eat I thought he was
                mad, but it has worked! I was eating the most I’ve eaten in a
                long time and still losing weight. Thom is the type of coach
                that regularly checks in with me, motivates me. He’s always on
                hand to answer any questions I may have, or listen to me moan
                about how much food he is making me eat! One of the the best
                things about Thom is seeing the joy he gets when you obtain your
                goals whether they are small or large.

                I know that I am only on the beginning of my journey with Thom,
                but I am feeling and looking the best I have done since I began
                my fitness journey. I am excited to keeping training with him
                and see what comes next. I thought as I’m hurtling towards 40
                that they were limitations as to what I could achieve but Thom
                has opened my eyes and made me realise anything is possible -
                Trust in Thom, stick to his plan and you will see the results
                you desire.

                Finding the correct balance for me when it comes to fitness and
                nutrition has always been a challenge. I have always had this
                mentality of dropping everything I enjoy including my social
                life when it comes to losing fat that has led me to an endless
                cycle of relapsing back to my old routine. I knew I had to
                change my approach to fitness as I was tired of finding ways on
                my own that lead me to the same wall. Also, as a working student
                in university I had a lot on my plate and having a routine that
                allows me to be flexible with food and training has been life
                changing. Before going for my summer holiday in 2019 I reached
                out to Thom for some help.

                The problem I needed to solve was my obesity. This led me to
                being uncomfortable with my body and diminished my confidence in
                every aspect of my life. I came across Thom a few times at the
                gym, where we both trained at. I looked at his instagram account
                and saw the huge transformation he had achieved for himself. As
                soon as we first talked at the consultation he was very
                motivating, honest and respectful of my goals. Thom at first
                instance made the plan crystal clear that the secret recipe to
                weight loss is simply counting your macros. His solution to my
                problem was something I didn't think was possible, that being
                able to eat the food I like, I have never felt hungry or wanting
                more whilst on the programme with Thom.

                Thom's style in training clients is one of a kind, it's
                something you cannot get anywhere else. Thom takes pride and
                cares for his clients in every aspect. He is always available
                when I have problems and he is always checking up on me as well
                as monitoring my progress. I was really impressed with Thom when
                he was still committed to me for reaching my goal, even during
                the first national lockdown in March 2020. Thom never gave up on
                me, even during certain stages of the plan, he would always find
                a way to work around any problems I had.

                Thom's training has made me realise how to approach diets and
                fitness, but also to appreciate the little goals we receive
                until we hit the final target. Having a personal trainer
                requires trust, Thom was the first person I have trusted
                completely with everything and this made me want to be under his
                influence in many aspects in life, not just fitness. The
                confidence I have gained from Thom is something I always
                imagined was impossible. Thom is a role model to me, but more
                importantly, he is a friend.

                  My weight problem started when I was young, which eventually
                  got worse when my family and I moved to England 15 years ago.
                  I had to adjust in a country with a completely different
                  environment and not knowing anyone made it worse. I had
                  difficulty fitting in, making new friends and I was not able
                  to speak or understand English at the time. I suppose food was
